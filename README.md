# Space Invaders

This game is a clone of the famous **Space Invaders** game.

You are controlling a space ship and you goal is to destroy all alien ships on the screen.

You can move left and right and shoot at alien ships. 

Alien ships can also shoot back and they will move closer to your ship over time.

Once the aliens touch your ship or your health points reach zero then it's game over. 

There are usually some barriers between you and the aliens which offers you defensive positions.
